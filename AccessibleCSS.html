            <h2 class="section">All About Typography</h2>
            <p class="headline">
                Headlines, like this one, are great ways to quickly capture the reader's attention, to
                give them a summary, intro, or other important information in a web page. You can use
                <code>text-transform: uppercase;</code> to make a whole body of text uppercase using CSS if you really
                need to grab attention!
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, now that we're done screaming in the headline in all caps (which you should do sparingly) - it's
                time to chat more about other components of typography. You'll notice that we chose a nice serif font
                for our
                headings, and a nice sans-serif font for our body text. This is intentional! Serif font faces are
                generally considered pretty inaccessible as a body text style, since at smaller sizes it's much more
                difficult to
                visually differentiate the characters from one another. At large font sizes, such as those seen in most
                headings, serif fonts are considered fine, since the larger style makes it easier to see where serif
                characters start and where they end.
            </p>
            <p>
                But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page? Another common thing you might see
                in
                web pages are quotes. To make quotes, we can use the <code>blockquote</code> element and style it
                accordingly, so it stands out a bit as a non-body text quote.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">"This is a quote - you probably knew that at a glance since we gave it some nice
                styling. Pretty nice, huh? A great lesson in User Experience Design, where we take special care to
                implement our web page in a way that makes it pleasant and intuitive for our users/readers.
                Differentiating our
                different typography components visually makes information much more organized and easier to digest for
                our users." <cite>â€“ A wise person</cite>

            <h3 id="newsection" class="section">A New Section</h3>
            <p>
                And just like that, we've got a new section of content separated by a <code>hr</code> element (a
                'horizontal rule' or a divider) and a new heading. Isn't putting content together fun?
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice as well that when we entered in the <code>H3</code> content, it was all lowercase, but now it's
                in
                a nice Title Case, where the first letter of each word is capitalized. We did that with CSS! Using
                <code>text-transform: capitalize;</code> we can implement title cased content.

            <h3 id="fontsize" class="section">Common Font Sizing Approaches</h3>
            <h4 id="pixels"><code>px</code> (pixels)</h4>
            <p>
                Pixels are the simplest way to hard code your font size. By default the browser sets the root font size
                to <code>16px</code>, but you can change the font size in the <code>body</code> element or any other
                HTML
                element by setting <code>font-size</code> to any number of <code>px</code>.
            </p>
            <h4 id="em"><code>em</code></h4>
            <p>
                <code>em</code> units size font relative to the parent element. For example, if the <code>body</code>
                element is <code>16px</code>, and a nested <code>div</code> element's font size is set to
                <code>1.5em</code>,
                the browser will multiply <code>16px</code> x 1.5, resulting in <code>24px</code> font in the
                <code>div</code>.
            </p>
            <h4 id="rem"><code>rem</code> (root em)</h4>
            <p>
                Root <code>em</code> units are similar to em, but they are relative to the root font size instead of the
                parent element of whatever is being styled. For example, if the root font size (the font size of the
                body element) is set to <code>16px</code>, and we have a <code>p</code> element nested many layers down
                with
                a <code>font-size</code> set to <code>2rem</code>, that paragraph will have <code>32px</code> font. If
                the
                body font size ever changes, this paragraph will also change accordingly.
            </p>
            <hr>


            <h4 id="usewhich" class="section">Which one do I use?</h4>
            <p>
                Great question! Generally, people try to stick to using <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code> over
                <code>px</code>, since they make responsive typography that scales up and down across different device
                widths much easier. Using px for your font sizes is not as dynamic, and you may find that writing media
                queries to update all the various element font sizes in pixels at different screen widths is not the
                most scalable approach to typography.
            </p>
            <p>
                Between <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code>, rem has a nice advantage of all elements being relative to
                one single root font value, where nested elements with parent/child font size dependencies can still be
                hard
                to manage with em units. When writing responsive styles, rem allows you to simply update the root font
                size
                at different screen sizes and all elements using rem units will adjust themselves accordingly creating a
                super easy-to-manage typography size system.
            </p>
            <p>
                In small projects you may not have issues hard coding pixelage, but it's always important to understand
                the drawbacks of writing styles that may not be responsive or dynamic.

            <p>
                Hello everyone, my name is Jeshua Dimawea!
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="orange"><strong>Hometown:</strong></span> I was born in Los Angeles, California, but grew
                up in many places
                such as Indonesia, Germany,
                Alaska, Colorado, etc... But where I call my hometown I would have to say is Jakarta Cipete Indonesia,
                as most of my family lives there.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="orange"><strong>Hometown Location:</strong></span> Jakarta Cipete is located around at 6
                degrees South
                latitude and 106 degrees East
                longitude.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="orange"><strong>Climate/Vegetation of my Hometown:</strong></span> Indonesia has a tropical
                climate, which
                means that it is hot and
                humid most of the
                time. It rains a lot, especially during the rainy season, which is the reason why there's a lot of
                jungle and plants. There are a lot of different kinds of plants and animals that live in these jungles
                and is very biodiverse.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="orange"><strong>A Favorite Place:</strong></span> A place I really like is CefalÃ¹, Sicily
                in Italy. It is a
                very beauitful place that I
                have visited about 4 years ago. It is such a beautiful place with warm weather, blue ocean, beautiful
                buildings, and friendly people. You can do many things such as hiking in the nearby mountains, swim in
                the ocean, go on a boat, eat at nice resteraunts, and a good night life. I added a picture below that I
                found on Google to show you.
