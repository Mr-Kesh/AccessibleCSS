            <h2 class="section" id="best-practices">Best Practices for Accessibility in Web Design</h2>
            <p class="headline">
                Accessibility in web design ensures that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use and
                navigate websites effectively. Using accessible design practices makes the web more inclusive and
                improves user experience for all.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the first steps in accessible design is choosing fonts and colors wisely. High contrast between
                text and background is essential for readability, especially for users with visual impairments.
                Additionally, sans-serif fonts are often preferred for body text because they are easier to read at
                smaller sizes, whereas serif fonts can be used for headings where readability is less affected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important aspect of accessibility is providing alternative text for images. Alternative (alt)
                text ensures that users with screen readers can understand the content and purpose of images. It’s also
                helpful to include descriptive labels and instructions for all interactive elements, so users with
                visual or cognitive impairments can navigate the website smoothly.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="quote">"Accessibility is not a feature, it’s a social trend. Accessible websites cater to
                a broader audience, improve SEO, and demonstrate a commitment to inclusivity. Web design that
                prioritizes accessibility is design that prioritizes people."

            <h2 class="section">Fundamentals of Accessible Design</h2>
            <h3 id="keyboard-navigation" class="subsection">Keyboard Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                Many users rely on keyboard navigation, so it's essential to ensure that every interactive element, like
                links and buttons, can be accessed and used via keyboard alone. Adding a visible focus state to each
                interactive element highlights where the user is on the page, making navigation more intuitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                When creating content sections, use semantic HTML elements such as <code>header</code>,
                <code>main</code>, <code>footer</code>, and appropriate heading levels (<code>H1</code>,
                <code>H2</code>, etc.). This helps screen readers understand the document structure and allows users to
                navigate through sections with ease.
            </p>

            <h3 id="color-contrast" class="subsection">Color Contrast</h3>
            <p>
                Color contrast is crucial for users with visual impairments. A good rule of thumb is to use a contrast
                ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker
                can help ensure your color choices meet accessibility standards.
            </p>

            <h3 id="alternative-text" class="subsection">Alternative Text</h3>
            <p>
                Providing alternative text (alt text) for images is an essential part of accessibility. Alt text allows
                screen readers to describe images to visually impaired users, ensuring that they don’t miss out on
                important information conveyed through visuals.
            </p>

            <h3 id="aria-roles-attributes" class="subsection">ARIA Roles and Attributes</h3>
            <p>
                ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes provide additional information about
                elements to assistive technologies. For example, setting <code>role="navigation"</code> on a
                <code>nav</code> element helps screen readers identify it as a navigation section. However, use ARIA
                sparingly and only when native HTML elements don’t provide enough context.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <h2 id="fontsize" class="section">Accessible Text and Layout Techniques</h2>
            <h3 id="accessible-font-size" class="subsection">Accessible Font Size</h3>
            <p>
                Ensuring that text is readable is a critical part of accessibility. A minimum font size of 16px is
                generally recommended, as it provides sufficient readability for most users. Adjust font sizes relative
                to the context, ensuring that body text is easy to read and headings are clearly distinguishable.
            </p>
            <h3 id="relative-units" class="subsection">Relative Units for Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
                Using relative units like <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> is preferred for creating accessible
                layouts. These units scale according to user settings, allowing text and other elements to adjust based
                on the root font size. This approach respects user preferences and makes websites more adaptable to
                different screen sizes and resolutions.
            </p>
            <h3 id="rem-scaling" class="subsection">Rem for Consistent Scaling</h3>
            <p>
                The <code>rem</code> unit is particularly useful for accessibility as it references the root font size,
                allowing all elements to scale consistently. For example, if the base font size is 16px and you set an
                element to <code>2rem</code>, it will render at 32px. This makes it easier to manage font sizes and
                ensures a consistent experience for users who adjust text size in their browser settings.
            </p>
            <hr>


            <h3 id="best-approach" class="section">Which Approach is Best for Accessibility?</h3>

            <p>
                Generally, using relative units like <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> is recommended for
                accessibility. Unlike fixed pixel values, these units allow text and layout elements to respond to user
                preferences. This flexibility is particularly important for users who need larger fonts or different
                screen settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Between <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code>, <code>rem</code> is often preferred because it creates a
                single, root-based scaling system across the entire document. This makes it easier to adjust font sizes
                globally by modifying the root size, which will automatically scale all elements using <code>rem</code>
                units.
            </p>
            <p>
                While pixel-based units can be useful in small, controlled projects, it’s important to understand that
                they may not provide a fully accessible experience. Opting for responsive, scalable units helps create a
                more inclusive design that accommodates various user needs and device types.

                <span class="orange"><strong>Hometown:</strong></span> I was born in Los Angeles, California, but grew
                up in many places
                such as Indonesia, Germany,
                Alaska, Colorado, etc... But where I call my hometown I would have to say is Jakarta Cipete Indonesia,
                as most of my family lives there.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="orange"><strong>Hometown Location:</strong></span> Jakarta Cipete is located around at 6
                degrees South
                latitude and 106 degrees East
                longitude.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="orange"><strong>Climate/Vegetation of my Hometown:</strong></span> Indonesia has a tropical
                climate, which
                means that it is hot and
                humid most of the
                time. It rains a lot, especially during the rainy season, which is the reason why there's a lot of
                jungle and plants. There are a lot of different kinds of plants and animals that live in these jungles
                and is very biodiverse.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="orange"><strong>A Favorite Place:</strong></span> A place I really like is Cefalù, Sicily
                in Italy. It is a
                very beauitful place that I
                have visited about 4 years ago. It is such a beautiful place with warm weather, blue ocean, beautiful
                buildings, and friendly people. You can do many things such as hiking in the nearby mountains, swim in
                the ocean, go on a boat, eat at nice resteraunts, and a good night life. I added a picture below that I
                found on Google to show you.
